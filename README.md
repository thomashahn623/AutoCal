# AutoCal

**AutoCal** is a lightweight open-source tool that automatically schedules tasks from your to-do list into available time slots in your calendar.

The goal is to create a flexible and self-hostable system that integrates with multiple calendar providers (Google Calendar, Outlook, CalDAV) and stays privacy-friendly – especially for users in the EU.

## 🔧 Core Features (initial scope)

- [ ] Simple task list with priorities and due dates
- [ ] Automatic scheduling of tasks into calendar events
- [ ] Calendar integrations (Google, Outlook, CalDAV – planned)
- [ ] Self-hosted, GDPR-friendly, no dependency on U.S. cloud services

## 🚧 Planned Extensions

AutoCal is designed to grow over time. Planned features include:

- ⏳ Habit tracking & recurring routines (like in Motion or Reclaim)
- 🧠 Smart rescheduling when conflicts occur
- 🗓️ Custom rules (e.g. no tasks after 5pm, deep work in the morning)
- 📈 Optional analytics (on-device or privacy-first)
- 🧩 Integration with tools like Notion, Todoist, and Jira
